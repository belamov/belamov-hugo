                worked on two projects:
                <ul>

                  <li>
                    <div>
                      integration platform of educational opportunities - aggregation of universities,
                      curricula, employers, vacancies, selections for students. developed a lot of functionality
                      on my own, for example, everything related to employers, vacancies, appliances, cv generation
                      from user data, full-text search with ranking and language processing (typos, synonyms),
                      filtering institutions and curricula, employer's admin panel and more. Worked on both
                      frontend and backend. lately been working as single developer on a project.
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                      this project was frozen several times (due to problems with sales) and I did not catch its
                      official launch
                    </div>
                  </li>
                  <br>
                  <li>
                    <div>
                      backend for the portals for citizens of the Murmansk and Sakhalin regions. the largest and
                      most complex challenge was the development of integration with goverment systems for managing
                      national and regional projects. three systems were connected (our portal, data bus, data source).
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div> thanks to the integration, several problems in the data source were found and fixed.</div>
                    <br>
                    <div>
                      the most difficult was the organizational component, work in the absence of sufficient
                      documentation. the requirements of our system were made for a long time, so over time I took over
                      the development of the data bus to speed up the process and less dependence on other teams
