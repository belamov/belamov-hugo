To be honest I'm not sure if this blog will be updated. The problem is lack of experience, so I can't write any usefull posts, not at my current level. Maybe I will remove this section completely untill I find topics I'm able to write about. We'll see in future.

*Updated:*

I read an interesting [article](http://pablojuan.com/want-to-blog-read-this/) that motivated me to write in my blog.

Main message of this article was to not give a fuck about your blog, because nobody will read it. Indeed, I'm not reading anyone's personal blog, and I'm really not interested in any. So why others should care about mine? Lack of experience is only a pity excuse. 

Additionally I will greatly improve my english by writing posts. I can read any english text effortless (in most cases), but writing and talking is still a big struggle. Hope it will get better.
