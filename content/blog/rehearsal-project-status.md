So I've finally began working on this project regularly. I've built two SPAs on my work, so I finally feel comfortable with frontend and vuejs.

I began to stream my work on this project with <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/belamov" target="_blank">twitch</a>. 

Also I'll be posting these livecoding streams at my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6pW-dee2xb1wWF4M58k-Sg" target="_blank">youtube channel</a>.

You can follow the progress at <a href="https://github.com/rehearsalsBooking" target="_blank">github</a>.
