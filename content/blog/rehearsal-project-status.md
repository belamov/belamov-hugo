so i've finally began working on this project regularly. i've built two spas on my work, so i finally feel comfortable with frontend and vuejs.

i began to stream my work on this project with <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/belamov" target="_blank">twitch</a>. 

also i'll be posting these livecoding streams at my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc6pw-dee2xb1wwf4m58k-sg" target="_blank">youtube channel</a>.
