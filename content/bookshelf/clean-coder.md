TL;DL: good book about soft skills mostly, I recommend it to every programmer

I've read this book about month ago, so my thoughts on it is not very fresh. 

Let's review this book chapter by chapter

#### Professionalism 

Really great material, makes you look at what you are doing from a different angle. I personally gained a lot from this chapter.

#### Saying No/Yes

Very good examples and useful behavioural patterns that makes you a real professional.

#### Coding

Arguable chapter. I didn't agree with author on some points.

#### TDD 

I dont't use TDD in my present work due to some factors. And to be honest I didn't think of this concept seriously. But author provides very strong arguments for using TDD, so I partly changed my opinion about this technique. Though he takes TDD to extreme, and I'm still not convinced to use TDD everywhere in work.

#### Practicing

This katas are stupid in my opinion. Not convinced at all. There are much better ways to practice your skills.

#### Acceptance Testing

Didn't understand this chapter at all. It didn't relate to me at all.

#### Testing Strategies

Read this chapter diagonally, not very useful and obvious.

#### Time management

Didn't read anything new. Every thought is obvious and already learned.

#### Estimation

This chapter on the other hand is most useful of this book. I do estimations a lot at my present work and I sucked at it. This chapter helped me hugely.

#### Pressure, Collaboration, Teams and Projects

Same as with time management. Didn't learn anything.

#### Mentoring

Very arguable stuff. I don't believe in mentoring and recon it is stupid and waste of time.
 
 
#### In conclusion

Though book contains a lot of arguable and obvious thoughts, I enjoyed it. It is well-written and well-structured. Language is simple. It is also very concrete. I don't think that time spend on this book is wasted, but I expected more from this author.

_my first book review, and I know I suck at it, hope it will get better_
