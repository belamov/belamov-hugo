Hi, my name is Dmitry Belamov, I'm from Russia, Tyumen (time zone GMT+5).

Firstly, i'm not native english speaker, so please don't mind any grammar mistakes. If you are kind enough, let me know about them. See [Contact](#contact) section.

I'm a beginner web developer (*junior, I guess? this junior/senior titles always confused me, they are really not clear*). I could be described as a full stack web developer, as I can do both front and back ends. If you are interested in my skills, visit [Projects](/projects) section, where you can find every project I've made. If you have no time for that, there is a short list of my skills:

#### Frontend:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Pug
- SCSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript (basic level)
- Angular 2 (basic level)
- JQuery
- Responsive

#### Backend:

- PHP7
- MySQL
- Laravel
- A little bit of Python3 with Django
- Some minor server configuration (Apache/Nginx)
 
 Lately I'm into backend development. I'm more into algorithms and data manipulation, buisness logic. But I can do frontend aswell
