this site you are browsing now.

it is made with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - static site generator.

## why hugo?

the main reason is that sites built with hugo don't need any runtime like php or python. so i can deploy such a site to a github pages, for example. no expencies on web hostings and easy deployment.

the other reason is that hugo is pretty simple to use. 

i didn't make this site from scratch, i used [vicky lai](https://vickylai.com)'s theme called [introduction](https://github.com/vickylaixy/hugo-theme-introduction). but i modified it a bit for my needs, for example i added projects page and a template for every project. by the way this theme uses [bulma](http://bulma.io/) - a css framework based on flexboxes. pretty interesting, but i personally didn't like it. bootstrap 4 looks cooler, but it is in beta at the moment.
