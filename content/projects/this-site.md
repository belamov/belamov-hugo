This site you are browsing now.

It is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - static site generator.

## Why hugo?

The main reason is that sites built with hugo don't need any runtime like PHP or Python. So i can deploy such a site to a Github Pages, for example. No expencies on web hostings and domain names (as for now, I plan to buy a normal domain name soon).

The other reason is that hugo is pretty simple to use. 

I didn't make this site from scratch, I used [Vicky Lai](https://vickylai.com)'s theme called [Introduction](https://github.com/vickylaixy/hugo-theme-introduction). But I modified it a bit for my needs, for example I added projects page and a template for every project. By the way this theme uses [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) - a CSS framework based on flexboxes. Pretty interesting, but I personally didn't like it. Bootstrap 4 looks cooler, but it is in beta at the moment.
