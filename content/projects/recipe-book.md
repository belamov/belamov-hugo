### This is a project I made on Udemy course about Angular 2
<br>
It is basically angular 2 app without any backend.

I integrated Google's firebase to store and retrieve all the recipes.

The goal of this project was to get acquainted with Angular 2. Nothing deep, just fundamental concepts such as routing, bounding, services, components, directives, MVC implementation and others. I think I achieved this goal. But to be honest I already forgot most of it, because I haven't done anything else using Angular 2 since then. It will take me some hours to refresh my skills.
 
 I planned to improve this project visually and functionally, but found something more interesting to do.
