This is a module for popular in Russia CMS called Bitrix.

This is somewhat useful project that could really be handy for somebody.
 
It was actually a work task, but it worked out so well that I decided to share it with world.

Basically this module allows you to display contents of any epub book on your bitrix-powered site. This is useful for SEO purposes, as it allows you to gain additional traffic from search results.

There is a [readme](https://github.com/belamov/epub-parser/blob/master/README.md) where you can find throughout instructions of how to use it.
