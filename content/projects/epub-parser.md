this is a module for popular in russia cms called bitrix.

this is somewhat useful project that could really be handy for somebody.
 
it was actually a work task, but it worked out so well that i decided to share it with world.

basically this module allows you to display contents of any epub book on your bitrix-powered site. this is useful for seo purposes, as it allows you to gain additional traffic from search results.

there is a [readme](https://github.com/belamov/epub-parser/blob/master/readme.md) where you can find throughout instructions of how to use it.
