This project is actually two different projects I combined together. These are frontend and backend.

## Frontend part

**Source code: [link](https://github.com/belamov/personal-site)**

I took psd templates made by Loftschool and made a static site.

**Technologies used:** 

 * HTML5
 * CSS3
 * Media Queries
 * JS 
 * jQuery
 * jQuery plugins (customised for my needs)
 * SVG
 * Pug
 * SCSS
 * gulp
 * bower
 * npm

No css frameworks/libraries used. Site is fully responsive.

*Note: I have nothing to do with design, all credits go to Loftschool designers*

## Backend part

**Source code: [link](https://github.com/belamov/admin-panel)**

Next step was to create a simple cms. I am aware of wordpress, MODX and other ready-to-use solutions. But at the moment I was learning Laravel, so I decided to make my own simple cms using this framework. The key goal was to become more confident in laravel, not to make real easy to use cms. Therefore there are not a lot of features, it is pretty simple.

Login and password for admin panel are public intentionally, so you can test it. 

**Features:** Posts, Skills, Categories management: all CRUD operations. Ajax requests. 

**Technologies used:**
 
 * HTML5
 * Bootstrap
 * jQuery
 * Ajax
 * PHP7
 * Laravel 5.4
