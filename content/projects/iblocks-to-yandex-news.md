This is a module for popular in Russia CMS called Bitrix.

It was actually a work task, client wanted to export its content to Yandex News feed. I'm aware that Bitrix has such functionality out of the box, but in my case I needed a lot of customisation. It was much easier and much more interesting for me to write my own module. A lot of additional functionality was removed from this module because it was highly tied to specific project and nobody could really use it.

There is a [readme](https://github.com/belamov/IblocksToYandexNews/blob/master/README.md) where you can find overview of this module's functionality and some instructions.
