This is my first ever freelance project. 

I was given psd files only for 1024px, but I had to make it responsive, so I improvised a bit. Anyway client was satisfied with the result.

**Technologies used:** 

 * HTML5
 * CSS3
 * Media Queries
 * JS 
 * jQuery
 * jQuery plugins. I used fancybox, and form validator.
 * SCSS

I have nothing to say about it really. Client didn't want any CMS. All backend contains only sending forms to email.
